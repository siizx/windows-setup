1. Set Execution Policy Permanently (System-Wide)
Run PowerShell as Administrator and set:

powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force
LocalMachine applies the policy to all users (requires admin rights).

RemoteSigned allows local scripts to run but requires downloaded scripts to be signed.

Revert Later (If Needed)
powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Force
